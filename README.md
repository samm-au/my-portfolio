## Thought process

Design:
For the design, I wanted to do something to show my creative side and personality. Nothing too serious, just cool and interesting. 

I really liked the idea of keeping everything simple and one page so I implemented the smooth scroll effect when the user clicks on the nav links.

I chose the dark theme because I personally prefer a dark theme. To me, it's easier on the eyes especially if you're looking at the screen for many hours a day.

Logic:

Before I started building, I thought about what I wanted my design to be and how it functioned. I went and sought inspiration from different sources and decided on the dark theme, one page website. 

I started off with the sections: header, main, navbar then footer. I started off building the main sections because it would make it easier for me to tweak the navbar so the auto scroll functionality would stop at their respective section of the website.

I then worked on the design and found inspiration for each different componenent and learnt how to implement them from different websites. The trickiest ones that too more time for me to digest were the CSS animations. 

Once the design is all done on the laptop view, I worked on the responsiveness for other screen sizes, implementing the hamburger bar menu on mobile and tablet. This was also quite tricky because I had to write some more Javascript for the drop down functionality.

In the future, I would definitely tweak the projects section by redesigning the projects layout. I'd also like to implement a light mode.
